 👋 Hi there, I'm Joel 👨‍💻
</h1>

<p align="left"> A former organic chemist who transitioned into software engineering, bringing a strong foundation in problem-solving and leadership. Fueled by a love of learning and actively seeking opportunities in software engineering and cloud development/technologies.
</p>
<p align="left">
Possesses a fundamental proficiency in Java, Python and is familiar with AWS and Docker. Some of the things I’m currently interested in are cloud-based development solutions, Docker, AWS, IoT development and backend engineering. I’ve been acknowledged for exceptional problem-solving abilities honed through extensive laboratory work and demonstrated an aptitude for leadership and mentorship while overseeing the organic chemistry labs at The Ohio State University and as a student at Tech Elevator.

Program Projects:
<ul>
<li>Candy Register Console App - Collaborated with a partner to develop a console application using Java and Object-Oriented Programming. The application loaded inventory from a CSV file and provided features such as viewing inventory, adding to a customer balance, making purchases, and generating receipts. Throughout these operations, the application also updated the inventory and kept a log of transactions in an external file. Given that this project was only four weeks into the program, I believe that it may not accurately showcase my current skills. If you would like to review the code, please feel free to ask.
</li>
 <li>
  TEnmo Software App - In collaboration with a partner, I engineered a robust application resembling Venmo by leveraging a technology stack comprising Spring Web MVC, Spring Boot, REST APIs, and authentication mechanisms   using JWT. This enabled seamless fund transfers between distinct users, with transaction details systematically stored in a database for secure and efficient record-keeping.
 </li>
</ul>
